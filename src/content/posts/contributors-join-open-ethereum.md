Last month we announced that the Parity Ethereum client will be transitioning to an open, collaborative project called OpenEthereum. Since then we have focused on building a broad base of contributors for the betterment and sustainability of the OpenEthereum client. Weâ€™re delighted to report that many teams have come forward to carry the torch and contribute to OpenEthereum.

Over 10 teams joined the first OpenEthereum workshop, including [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/), [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org), [ETCLabs](https://etclabs.org/), [DappNode](https://dappnode.io/), [POA network](https://www.poa.network/), [Lab10 Collective](https://lab10.coop/), [ETC Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org/), [OST](https://ost.com/), [Lukso](https://www.lukso.network/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Neufund](https://neufund.org), and several other independent developers and researchers. At the workshop, we reviewed the codebase and infrastructure requirements, discussed how to collaborate, and reviewed the merits of using a DAO.

At Parity, we were originally interested in using a DAO to aid collaboration and handle the legalities around transitioning the software license from Parity. However, after hearing feedback that OpenEthereum collaborators would be more comfortable contributing under a GPL license as it stands instead of a DAO-owned license, we decided to take a step back from pursuing a DAO and keep the codebase under the GPLv3 license for now.

## **Next steps for OpenEthereum**

- Contributors will work to make sure the client is compatible with the next Ethereum foundation fork, [Berlin](https://eth.wiki/roadmap/berlin/).
- Contributors will set up workflows for coordination, communicating updates, status on upcoming hard forks, and security fixes.
- Contributors will set up OpenEthereum core dev calls.

We are happy to see OpenEthereum begin with a strong start and thankful for the contributors for being a part of this open-source initiative.
